### Description

Explore the possibilities, history, and ethics surrounding data science.

### Objectives

1. Introduce the skills needed to be a data scientist.
2. Introduce an understanding of the data science process.
3. Apply the data science process to case studies using exploratory data analysis.
4. Compare data science approaches and their ethical considerations.
5. Explain the purpose of various programming languages used in data science.

### Notes

The assigned task was to create a research poster and extended abstract and my topic was Facebook. While the project
did not have us doing any other EDA type of work, the amount of criticial thinking for this course was a great
introduction to the field and taught me how important not only data and information are in data science, but
also, that ethics should play a larger role as well, and that it is often overlooked.
