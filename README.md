## MSDS DSC500 Introduction to Data Science

### Course Description:

This course introduces the possibilities, history, and ethics surrounding Data Science. Basics of data science are explored, including vocabulary, programming languages, big data frameworks, visualization, and statistics. Prior programming experience is not needed for this course.

### Course Objectives:

1. Describe the skills needed to be a data scientist.
2. Demonstrate an understanding of the data science process.
3. Apply the data science process to case studies using exploratory data analysis.
4. Compare data science approaches and their ethical considerations.
5. Explain the purpose of various programming languages used in data science.
6. Develop a portfolio of data science projects.

### Course Notes:

This course was the first in the program, and proved to be a great study in getting started in data science.

The final project was to create a research poster and abstract and my topic was Facebook. While this course
did not have us doing any other EDA type of work, the amount of criticial thinking for this course was a great
introduction to the field and taught me how important that not only data and information are in data science, but
also, that ethics also play a role, and that it is often overlooked by organizations.
