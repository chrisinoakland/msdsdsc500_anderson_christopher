This course was the first in the program, and proved to be a great study in getting started in data science.

The final project was to create a research poster and abstract and my topic was Facebook. While this course
did not have us doing any other EDA type of work, the amount of criticial thinking for this course was a great
introduction to the field and taught me how important that not only data and information are in data science, but
also, that ethics also play a role, and that it is often overlooked by organizations.
